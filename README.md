# Vesper

Vesper is a lightweight 2D/3D engine and editor inspired by TheCherno's Game Engine Architecture series for the Hazel engine.  
It provides a renderer, scene & entity system, editor UI, input handling, and utilities to build simple games and interactive applications in C++ (C++17).

It is generally usable as an easily modifiable base line for creating graphics and software applications.

> The specific purpose is for the creation of Particle System demos, experiments, and visualizations.
>
> ***It is not intended to be a full-featured game engine,***
>
> But rather an application to create a range of visual effects and particle system simulations.

## Quick overview

- Language: C++17
- Primary IDE: Visual Studio 2022
- Platforms: Windows (Visual Studio solution & VCXPROJ files provided)
  - Planned: Linux, macOS
- Build system: Premake5
- Third-party libraries:
  - entt (entity-component system)
  - Glad (OpenGL function loading)
  - GLFW (windowing and input)
  - glm (math library)
  - ImGui (editor UI)
  - spdlog (logging)
  - stb (image loading)
- Core features:
  - Scene / Entity / Component system
  - 2D renderer with orthographic and perspective cameras
  - ImGui-based editor layer
  - Input and event handling
  - Starter particle system and instrumentation

## Getting started (clone + third-party libs)

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/nomadiidamon/Vesper <desiredLocation>
```

## Build (Visual Studio 2022)

1. Run the 'Win-GenProjects.bat' script from the repository root 'Vesper/scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat' to generate the Visual Studio solution file (`.sln`).
	- This runs Premake5 which is located in 'Vesper/Vendor/bin/premake'.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022.
3. Select the desired configuration (e.g. `Debug` or `Release`) and platform (`x64`).
4. Right-click the project you want to run (`Vesper-Editor` or `Sandbox`) and choose __Set as Startup Project__.
5. Build and run (F5).

Troubleshooting:
- Ensure the Windows SDK and Visual C++ toolset for VS2022 are installed.
- If include or linker errors appear, confirm vendor project builds (GLFW, Glad, ImGui, etc.) and that project dependencies are set correctly.
- For unresolved externals, confirm platform (x86/x64) consistency across projects.

## New Project example code
```cpp
#include <Vesper.h>
#include <Vesper/Core/EntryPoint.h> // can only be included in one source file

#include "imgui/imgui.h"

class ExampleLayer : public Vesper::Layer
{
public:
	ExampleLayer()
		: Layer("ExampleLayer")
	{
	}

	~ExampleLayer() override = default;

	// Called once when the layer is attached to the layer stack
	void OnAttach() override {}

	// Called once when the layer is detached from the layer stack
	void OnDetach() override {}

	// Called every frame with the frame time
	void OnUpdate(Vesper::Timestep ts) override {}

	// Render ImGui UI for this layer (optional)
	void OnImGuiRender() override {
		ImGui::Begin("Example Layer");
		ImGui::Text("Hello from ExampleLayer!");
		ImGui::End();
	}

	// Receive events (keyboard/mouse/window/etc.)
	void OnEvent(Vesper::Event& e) override {}
};

class YourAppNameHere : public Vesper::Application
{
public:
	YourAppNameHere() {

		PushLayer(new ExampleLayer());
	}

	~YourAppNameHere() {	}
};

Vesper::Application* Vesper::CreateApplication() {
	return new YourAppNameHere();
}
```
